Glass of water
--------------

Version 2019-12-27

Simple musical instrument made with glasses of water. It was recorded by
Roberto <roberto@zenvoid.org> on October 2019, initially as an example for a
workshop in Medialab-Prado. It turned out more interesting than expected and
it's now transformed into a sound bank.

Recorded with an AKG Perception 120 microphone and glasses of water, carefully
filled to tune into chromatic sounds with aproximate note range from A4 to G6.

This sound bank, in several formats and qualities, is available on the
FreePats project web pages: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/
